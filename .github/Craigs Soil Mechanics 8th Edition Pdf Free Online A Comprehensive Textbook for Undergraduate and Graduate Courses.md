The book is suitable for students of civil engineering, geotechnical engineering, environmental engineering, and related disciplines. It is also a valuable reference for practising engineers, researchers, and consultants who deal with soil mechanics and geotechnical design.

The following sections provide a brief overview of each chapter of the book.
 
## Chapter 1: Basic concepts and definitions
 
This chapter introduces the basic concepts and definitions of soil mechanics, such as soil phases, soil particles, soil structure, soil weight-volume relationships, specific gravity, unit weight, void ratio, porosity, degree of saturation, water content, and air content. It also explains the difference between coarse-grained and fine-grained soils, and the methods of soil identification.
 
## Chapter 2: Soil classification and compaction
 
This chapter discusses the importance and methods of soil classification, such as the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), the British Standard Classification System (BSCS), and the International Soil Classification System (ISCS). It also describes the principles and procedures of soil compaction, such as the standard Proctor test, the modified Proctor test, the field compaction methods, and the factors affecting compaction.
 
## Chapter 3: Effective stress and pore water pressure
 
This chapter explains the concept of effective stress, which is the stress carried by the soil skeleton. It also covers the pore water pressure, which is the pressure exerted by the water in the soil pores. It shows how to calculate the effective stress and pore water pressure in various situations, such as under hydrostatic conditions, under applied loads, in partially saturated soils, and during drainage and consolidation.
 
## Chapter 4: Permeability and seepage
 
This chapter deals with the permeability and seepage of soils, which are related to the flow of water through soils. It defines the coefficient of permeability and its units, and describes the factors affecting permeability. It also presents the methods of measuring permeability in the laboratory and in the field. It then introduces the concept of seepage and its consequences, such as piping and heave. It also explains how to analyze seepage problems using Darcy's law, flow nets, seepage forces, and seepage control measures.
 
## Chapter 5: Stress distribution and settlement
 
This chapter covers the stress distribution and settlement of soils due to external loads. It introduces the concept of stress in soils and its components, such as normal stress and shear stress. It also explains how to calculate the vertical stress at any point below a surface load using Boussinesq's equation and Westergaard's equation. It then discusses the elastic settlement of soils due to compression and shear deformation. It also presents the methods of estimating settlement from laboratory tests and field observations.
