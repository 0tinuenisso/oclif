In this article, we will show you how to install and access AutoCAD P&ID 2017, how to start a basic project and drawing, and how to quickly lay out your P&ID using the built-in tools and libraries.
 
## How to Install and Access AutoCAD P&ID 2017
 
AutoCAD P&ID 2017 is part of the AutoCAD with Specialized Toolsets and the Architecture, Engineering & Construction Collection. You can download it from your Autodesk Account or use the Autodesk Desktop App. You will need a valid subscription and an internet connection to activate the software.
 
To access AutoCAD P&ID 2017, you can either launch it from the Windows Start menu or from the Autodesk Desktop App. You will see the AutoCAD P&ID splash screen and then the application window. You can also switch to AutoCAD P&ID 2017 from within AutoCAD by clicking on the A icon in the upper-left corner and selecting AutoCAD P&ID from the list of toolsets.
 
## How to Start a Basic Project and Drawing
 
To start a new project in AutoCAD P&ID 2017, you can either use the default project template or create your own custom project. A project is a collection of drawings that share common settings and data. To create a new project, click on the Project Manager icon on the ribbon or press CTRL+0. Then click on New Project and follow the steps in the wizard.
 
To start a new drawing in AutoCAD P&ID 2017, you can either use one of the predefined drawing templates or create your own custom drawing. A drawing is a single file that contains your P&ID elements, such as lines, valves, equipment, instruments, tags, annotations, etc. To create a new drawing, click on the New icon on the Quick Access Toolbar or press CTRL+N. Then select a drawing template from the list or browse to your own template file.
 
## How to Quickly Lay Out Your P&ID
 
AutoCAD P&ID 2017 provides you with a variety of tools and libraries to help you create your P&ID faster and easier. You can use the ribbon tabs to access different categories of commands, such as Home, Insert, Annotate, Manage, etc. You can also use the command line or the right-click menu to enter commands.
 
To add P&ID elements to your drawing, you can either use the Insert tab on the ribbon or use the Tool Palette. The Insert tab contains buttons for inserting different types of elements, such as lines, valves, equipment, instruments, etc. The Tool Palette contains icons for inserting predefined elements from various libraries, such as ANSI/ISA S5.1-1984 (R1992), DIN EN ISO 10628-1:2001-12 (E), etc. You can also customize your own libraries and palettes.
 
To edit P&ID elements in your drawing, you can either use the Home tab on the ribbon or use the Properties Palette. The Home tab contains buttons for modifying different properties of elements, such as color, layer, linetype, size, etc. The Properties Palette contains fields for changing different attributes of elements, such as tag number, description, manufacturer, etc. You can also use grips and handles to move, rotate, scale, copy, etc.
