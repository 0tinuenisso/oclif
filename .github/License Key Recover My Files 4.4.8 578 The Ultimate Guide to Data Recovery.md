## Troubleshooting Activation Issues
 
If you encounter any problems while activating Recover My Files, here are some possible solutions:

- Make sure you enter the correct license key without any spaces or typos.
- Make sure your computer is connected to the internet and has no firewall or antivirus software blocking the communication with the GetData activation server.
- Make sure you have not exceeded the maximum number of activations allowed by your license type. A standard license allows two activations on two computers, while a Technician license allows unlimited activations with a dongle.
- If you need to move your license to another computer, you need to deactivate an existing installation first by using the GetData License Manager tool. You can download it from [here](https://download.getdata.com/support/LicenseManager.exe).
- If none of these solutions work, you can contact GetData customer support for further assistance.
