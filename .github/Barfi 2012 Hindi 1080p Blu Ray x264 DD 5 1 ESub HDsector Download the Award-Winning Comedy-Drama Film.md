## Barfi 2012 Hindi 1080p Blu Ray x264 DD 5 1 ESub HDSector: A Critique
 
Barfi is widely regarded as one of the best films of 2012 and received critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay, performances and music. The film won several awards, including seven Filmfare Awards, three National Film Awards and five IIFA Awards. It was also India's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 85th Academy Awards, but did not make the final shortlist.
 
However, the film also faced some controversies and criticisms. Some critics accused the film of being inspired by or copying scenes from various Hollywood films, such as The Notebook, The Adventurer, Benny & Joon and Singin' in the Rain. Basu defended his film by saying that he was influenced by many films and that he did not plagiarize any of them. He also said that he wanted to pay homage to the silent era of cinema and Charlie Chaplin.
 
Another criticism was that the film portrayed disability in a stereotypical and unrealistic way. Some activists and experts argued that the film did not show the challenges and struggles faced by people with disabilities in India. They also said that the film used disability as a tool for comedy and romance, rather than as a human condition. Basu responded by saying that he did not intend to offend anyone and that he wanted to show that people with disabilities can live happily and normally.
