In July 2017, SKIDROW, a group of hackers who have been cracking PC games for a decade since their comeback in the scene, issued a statement to mark their anniversary. In their statement, they hinted that they were not impressed by the methods used by other cracking groups such as CONSPIR4CY, STEAMPUNKS, and some members of the Steam Underground warez forum to bypass modern copy protection systems. They suggested that these methods were not proper or elegant.[8] However, their remarks were met with criticism and ridicule on the web, as many pointed out that SKIDROW's own standards for a proper crack were inconsistent and hypocritical. For example, they had emulated Ubisoft's DRM that required a constant online connection, instead of removing it. They had also cracked a game protected by Denuvo by using the executable file from another game that was already cracked.[37]

SKIDROW's statement sparked a heated debate among the cracking community and the gamers who rely on their releases. Some defended SKIDROW's position, arguing that they were the pioneers of cracking and that they had a right to criticize the newcomers who were using shortcuts and hacks. Others accused SKIDROW of being arrogant, jealous, and out of touch with the current state of the art in cracking. They pointed out that SKIDROW had failed to crack many games that were protected by Denuvo, while other groups had succeeded.[38]
  
The controversy also highlighted the different approaches and philosophies of cracking among different groups. Some groups, such as CONSPIR4CY and STEAMPUNKS, focused on cracking games as quickly and efficiently as possible, regardless of the technical elegance or complexity of their methods. They often used generic tools and techniques that could be applied to multiple games with minimal modifications. Other groups, such as SKIDROW and CPY, preferred to crack games in a more sophisticated and customized way, aiming to remove or disable the copy protection systems completely, rather than bypassing or emulating them. They often took longer to crack games, but claimed to offer more stable and reliable releases.[39]

The debate also raised questions about the ethics and legality of cracking. Some argued that cracking was a form of digital activism and resistance against the oppressive and intrusive practices of the game publishers and developers, who imposed unfair and restrictive DRM systems on their products. They claimed that cracking was a way of preserving the rights and freedoms of the gamers, who should be able to play their games without being monitored or controlled by the corporations. Others argued that cracking was a form of piracy and theft, which harmed the game industry and discouraged innovation and creativity. They claimed that cracking was a way of stealing the intellectual property and hard work of the game creators, who deserved to be compensated for their efforts.[40]
  
The debate also revealed the challenges and risks faced by the cracking groups and the gamers who used their releases. Cracking groups often operated in secrecy and anonymity, to avoid being detected and prosecuted by the law enforcement agencies and the game publishers. They also faced competition and rivalry from other groups, who sometimes tried to sabotage or discredit their releases. Gamers who used cracked games also faced potential dangers, such as malware infections, corrupted files, compatibility issues, and online bans. They also missed out on some features and updates that were only available for the legitimate users of the games.[41]
  
The debate also showed the impact and influence of cracking on the game industry and the gaming culture. Cracking groups often had a loyal fan base and a large online presence, which gave them a significant role in shaping the opinions and preferences of the gamers. They also had a direct effect on the sales and revenues of the game publishers and developers, who sometimes adjusted their prices and policies in response to the cracking activities. Some game creators even acknowledged and praised the cracking groups for their skills and achievements, while others condemned and criticized them for their illegal and unethical actions.[42]
