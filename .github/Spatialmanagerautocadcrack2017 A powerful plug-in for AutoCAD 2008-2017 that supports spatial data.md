Spatial Manager for AutoCAD 2017 is a powerful plug-in that allows you to import, export, transform and manage spatial data in a simple, fast and inexpensive way. It includes many functionalities not seen so far in AutoCAD, such as background maps, thematic maps, data management, spatial analysis, location tools, Google Street View integration, terrains and more. In this article, we will show you how to use some of the main features of Spatial Manager for AutoCAD 2017.

## Importing Spatial Data
 
One of the most useful features of Spatial Manager for AutoCAD 2017 is the ability to import spatial data from various sources, such as files, data servers or data stores. You can import data into new or existing AutoCAD drawings, as AutoCAD objects and extended entity data (EED/XDATA). You can also transform the coordinates of the imported data if they have a different coordinate system than the drawing.
 
To import spatial data, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Click on the Import button on the Spatial Manager toolbar or ribbon.
2. Select the source of the data from the drop-down list. You can choose from files (such as shapefiles, KML, GeoJSON, etc.), servers (such as PostGIS, SQL Server, etc.) or stores (such as OpenStreetMap).
3. Browse or enter the path to the source file or database.
4. Select the layers or tables that you want to import from the source.
5. Optionally, you can apply filters or queries to select only the features that match certain criteria.
6. Optionally, you can choose a different coordinate system for the source data if it is not compatible with the drawing.
7. Click Next to proceed to the Import options dialog.
8. Select the target layer where you want to import the data. You can create a new layer or use an existing one.
9. Select the object type that you want to create from the imported data. You can choose from points, polylines, polygons or blocks.
10. Select the fields that you want to import as EED/XDATA. You can also rename or reorder them.
11. Optionally, you can choose to label the imported objects with their EED/XDATA values.
12. Optionally, you can choose to create thematic maps based on the EED/XDATA values.
13. Click Import to start the import process.

You will see a progress bar and a summary of the imported data. You can also view the imported objects and their EED/XDATA in the Data Grid palette.
 
## Exporting Spatial Data
 
Spatial Manager for AutoCAD 2017 also allows you to export spatial data from your drawings to various formats, such as files, data servers or data stores. You can export objects and their EED/XDATA as alphanumeric data tables. You can also transform the coordinates of the exported data if they have a different coordinate system than the target.
 
To export spatial data, you need to follow these steps:
