The movie is a blend of action, drama, comedy and romance, with amazing cinematography and superb songs. The movie also showcases the cultural diversity of India, as it features characters from different religions, languages and backgrounds.
 
The movie has three segments, each focusing on one David and his story. The first segment is set in London in 1975, where David (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is a loyal henchman of a mafia don who controls the Muslim community. He falls in love with Noor, the don's ward, but faces betrayal and tragedy when he learns the truth about his past and his master's plans. The second segment is set in Mumbai in 1999, where David (Vinay Virmani / Jiiva) is an aspiring musician who lives with his father, a Christian priest who does charity work for the poor. He faces a crisis of faith when his father is attacked by a Hindu extremist politician who accuses him of converting people. The third segment is set in Goa in 2010, where David (Vikram) is a drunkard fisherman who suffers from bipolar disorder. He meets Frenny (Tabu), a deaf and mute woman who teaches him sign language and helps him cope with his condition. He also meets Roma (Isha Sharvani), a young woman who is about to marry his best friend Peter (Nassar). He falls in love with her and decides to stop the wedding.
