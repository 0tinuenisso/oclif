When we plug the cable into the printer and the computer, the computer will attempt to identify the printer model and find a suitable driver for it. A driver is a software that allows the computer to communicate with the printer and send printing commands. If the computer has a compatible driver, it can automatically install it and enable us to print documents. However, if the computer fails to recognize the printer, we need to manually install the driver ourselves. Fortunately, the new printer comes with a CD that contains a Printer driver for various operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. By inserting the CD into the computer and following the instructions, we can install the driver and use the printer.

Installing the driver is not the only step to set up the printer. We also need to configure the printer settings according to our preferences and needs. For example, we can choose the paper size, orientation, quality, and color mode of the printouts. We can also adjust the ink level, alignment, and cleaning of the printer head. These settings can be accessed from the printer software on the computer or from the printer control panel on the device.
  
Another important aspect of using the printer is to maintain it properly. This includes replacing the ink cartridges when they run out, loading the paper tray correctly, and clearing any paper jams that may occur. We should also avoid exposing the printer to extreme temperatures, humidity, or dust that may damage it. By following these simple tips, we can extend the life of our printer and ensure its optimal performance.
